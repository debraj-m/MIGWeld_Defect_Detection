An advanced computer vision pipeline for automated defect detection in Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding processes using state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection. This project enables real-time quality control and inspection in industrial welding applications.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a complete object detection solution developed during an AI/ML internship to support automated quality control in industrial welding processes. The system can identify and classify various types of welding defects that are critical for ensuring structural integrity and safety standards.

## üîç Defect Types Detected

The model is trained to detect the following MIG weld defects:

- **üî¥ Crack**: Linear discontinuities that can compromise structural integrity
- **üü° Excess Reinforcement**: Excessive weld metal above the base material surface
- **üîµ Porosity**: Gas pockets trapped within the weld metal
- **üü† Spatter**: Metal particles expelled during welding
- **üü¢ Welding Seam**: Proper weld identification for quality verification

## üìä Performance Metrics

Our trained model achieves excellent performance on the test dataset:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Precision** | ~90% |
| **Recall** | ~88% |
| **mAP@0.5** | ~92% |

*Results may vary based on training parameters and dataset characteristics*

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Base Model**: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8)
- **Variants**: Support for `yolov8n.pt` (nano) and `yolov8s.pt` (small)
- **Training Method**: Transfer learning from pretrained COCO weights
- **Input Resolution**: 640x640 pixels
- **Framework**: Ultralytics YOLOv8

## üìÅ Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized in YOLO format with the following structure:

```

- Number of classes (5 defect types)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debraj-m/MIGWeld_Defect_Detection.git
cd MIGWeld_Defect_Detection
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Verify installation**:
```bash
yolo --version
```

### Training

Train the model on your dataset:

```bash
# Basic training with YOLOv8 nano
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640

# Advanced training with custom parameters
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8s.pt data=data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640 batch=16 lr0=0.01
```

### Validation

Evaluate the trained model:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=val model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt data=data.yaml
```

### Inference

Run predictions on new images:

```bash
# Single image prediction
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source=path/to/image.jpg

# Batch prediction
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source=path/to/images/

# Real-time webcam detection

### Python API

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the trained model
model = YOLO('runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt')

# Run inference
results = model('path/to/weld_image.jpg')

# Process results
for result in results:
    # Get bounding boxes, scores, and class predictions
    boxes = result.boxes.xyxy.cpu().numpy()
    scores = result.boxes.conf.cpu().numpy()
    classes = result.boxes.cls.cpu().numpy()
    
    # Print detections
    for box, score, cls in zip(boxes, scores, classes):
        class_name = model.names[int(cls)]
        print(f"Detected {class_name} with confidence {score:.2f}")
```

### Custom Training Script

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Initialize model

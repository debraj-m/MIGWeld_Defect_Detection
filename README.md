# MIG Weld Defect Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based system to detect and classify defects in MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding processes. The work is conducted under a research internship at IIT Kharagpur in collaboration with the BiW (Body-in-White) project.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Automated defect detection in MIG welding is crucial for ensuring the structural integrity of vehicle chassis components in automotive manufacturing. Manual inspection is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error. This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that identifies welding defects using visual and signal-based data to enhance quality control in the BiW manufacturing process.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a dataset of MIG welding images with labeled defect types.
- Apply deep learning-based object detection (YOLO) for localizing defects.
- Correlate visual outputs with weld signal parameters.
- Optimize model performance for real-time application on edge devices.

## 🛠️ Methodology

- **Model**: YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and defect localization.
- **Training**: Conducted using annotated image datasets of welds with labeled defects.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: mAP, precision, recall, and inference speed.
- **Post-Processing**: Visual overlays and signal correlation using statistical tools.

## 📊 Dataset

- MIG weld images sourced from controlled welding experiments.
- Defect classes include: porosity, undercut, crack, burn-through, and lack of fusion.
- Annotated in YOLO format for seamless training integration.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debraj-m/MIGWeld_Defect_Detection.git
cd MIGWeld_Defect_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

To train the model:

```bash
python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg yolov8.yaml --weights yolov8n.pt --epochs 100
```

To test the model:

```bash
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --source test_images/
```

## 📈 Results

* Achieved **mAP\@0.5 > 85%** for defect classification.
* Robust detection of small and overlapping defects.
* Good generalization on unseen weld samples.

## 📌 Key Insights

* Visual cues in conjunction with weld signal analysis improve detection reliability.
* Porosity and undercut are more visually separable than internal cracks or burn-throughs.
* Real-time detection on low-power devices is feasible with optimized YOLO variants.
